# Description of the project
In this assignment you will practive data types in C++ and Python. \
It is up to you to choose programming language for the task, however one PL **may not** cover more than 80%(i.e. 4 tasks) of all tasks.

You may use **google colab** for the assignment and export it as .py file, then put the file to **src\py** directory.

_Before submitting, make sure the code is running with no errors._

## Tasks:

---
1. **Leap Year Detective**

In a mysterious town, there was a detective named Rustam who specialized in finding leap years. He had a special calendar that had been passed down for generations.

Your task is to create a program in C/C++ or Python that helps Rustam determine if a given year is a leap year or not.
You need to take the year as input and display whether it's a leap year or not based on the leap year rules.

2. **Guess the Number**

In a distant galaxy, there was an ancient temple guarded by a wise old robot. To enter the temple, one had to guess the correct number.

Your task is to create a guessing game in C/C++ or Python. The program should generate a random number between 1 and 100, and the player needs to guess that number.
Provide hints such as "too high" or "too low" after each guess. The player should continue guessing until they find the correct number. Make sure to use loops, conditionals, and appropriate data types for this challenging task.

3. **Long arithmetics**

Write a program to input number A, then generate 100 digit number and divide it by A.
Print the result.

---
4. **String matching**

Write a program to input a sentence and a word then return bool.
If the word matches any part of the sentence then return index of matching substring, else print “no match”.

---
5. **Spawn prediction**

You are being interviewed to algorithmist position at Fortnite.
You are asked to write a program to input N times coordinates where a character should be dropped off from the plane.
Depending on the set of coordinates you should spawn enemies.
For the next coordinate, the algorithms should understand your next input and print if the character died or not.


## Project structure
Design your project structure wisely, so that your source code do not overlap and conflict. \
Here is an example:

- `cpp` - c++ files header files (.cpp, .h files).
- `py` - python source code (.py)

```
MyProject
 ├── cpp
 │   ├── main.cpp
 │   └── fibboalgo.h
 └── py
     ├── main.py
     └── algo1.py
```
